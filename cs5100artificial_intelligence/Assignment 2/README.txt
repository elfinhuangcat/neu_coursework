Final version 2.1:
I think this version works well this time.

Developing environment:
Windows 7, Python 3.3

Instructions:
1.Put your world input file under the directory "source code". The name of the file doesn't matter.
  If there is already a copy of it, feel free to overwrite it.
2.Revise the path in the file "source code\prover9path".
  My program will automatically read this file and use this path as the prover9.exe's path.
  Please revise the path according to this format:
      C:\Users\Elfin\Desktop\LADR1007B-win\bin\prover9
3.In command line, cd to this directory (assign2) and type:
      python main
  Press Enter to run the program.
4.The program will require you to input the world input file you put under "source code".
  Please input the name of it, eg. "wumpus_world.txt".
5.Wait and see the result.
6.You can also find the result in the log.txt under the directory "source code".
  Because every time you run the program, the output will be "added" to the log file, so the most recent
  play will be at the final part of the log file.
