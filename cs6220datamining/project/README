The program is tested on both Mac and Linux machines.
Because of the library issue, we generated the JAR file from ecplise directly, 
and the source code can be found in "src" folder.
To run the final procedure we adopted (c4.5 with AdaBoost):
1. Unzip the data. The destination might be the "data" folder in this directory.
   We are using the comma-separated training and testing files.
2. Translate the training and testing files by:
   (1) Open the terminal, cd to this directory.
   (2) Run this command:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -arff ./data/census-income.data ./data/train.arff ./data/census-income.test ./data/test.arff
   The arguments are
   [0] "arff" - the option to translate the data
   [1] training data path
   [2] training arff destination path
   [3] testing data path
   [4] testing data destination path
3. After you got the ARFF files, run the following command:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -boo -c45 ./data/train.arff ./data/test.arff
   This will run the c45 with adaboost.
4. If you want to try other options, you can run:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -bag <train_arff_path> <test_arff_path>
   With "-bag" option it will runs the bagging procedure.

   $ java -jar datamining.jar -boo <classifier> <train_arff_path> <test_arff_path>
   With "-boo" option it will run the boosting on the base learner you input.
   Valid options for <classifier> are:
   [1] -c45    which is C4.5
   [2] -knn    which is KNN
   [3] -nb     which is Naive Bayes
   [4] -nbt    which is NBTree
   
About the data source:
The data is a line-based comma seperated text file and the description is below:
| This data was extracted from the census bureau database found at
| http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html
| Donor: Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker,
|        Data Mining and Visualization
|        Silicon Graphics.
|        e-mail: ronnyk@sgi.com for questions.
| Split into train-test using MLC++ GenCVFiles (2/3, 1/3 random).
| 48842 instances, mix of continuous and discrete    (train=32561, test=16281)
| 45222 if instances with unknown values are removed (train=30162, test=15060)
| Duplicate or conflicting instances : 6
| Class probabilities for adult.all file
| Probability for the label '>50K'  : 23.93% / 24.78% (without unknowns)
| Probability for the label '<=50K' : 76.07% / 75.22% (without unknowns)
|
| Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of
|   reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions:
|   ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
|
| Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K
| a year.

| Error Accuracy reported as follows, after removal of unknowns from
|    train/test sets):
|    C4.5       : 84.46+-0.30
|    Naive-Bayes: 83.88+-0.30
|    NBTree     : 85.90+-0.28
|
|
| Following algorithms were later run with the following error rates,
|    all after removal of unknowns and using the original train/test split.
|    All these numbers are straight runs using MLC++ with default values.

| Conversion of original data as follows:
| 1. Discretized agrossincome into two ranges with threshold 50,000.
| 2. Convert U.S. to US to avoid periods.
| 3. Convert Unknown to "?"
| 4. Run MLC++ GenCVFiles to generate data,test.
|
| Description of fnlwgt (final weight)
|
| The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the
| civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly
| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of
| controls.
|  These are:
|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.
|
| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through
| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.
|
| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating
| "weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the
| population.
|
| People with similar demographic characteristics should have
| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember
| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is
| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own
| probability of selection, the statement only applies within
| state.
