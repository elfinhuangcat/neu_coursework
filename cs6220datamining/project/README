The program is tested on both Mac and Linux machines.
Because of the library issue, we generated the JAR file from ecplise directly, 
and the source code can be found in "src" folder.
To run the final procedure we adopted (c4.5 with AdaBoost):
1. Unzip the data. The destination might be the "data" folder in this directory.
   We are using the comma-separated training and testing files.
2. Translate the training and testing files by:
   (1) Open the terminal, cd to this directory.
   (2) Run this command:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -arff ./data/census-income.data ./data/train.arff ./data/census-income.test ./data/test.arff
   The arguments are
   [0] "arff" - the option to translate the data
   [1] training data path
   [2] training arff destination path
   [3] testing data path
   [4] testing data destination path
3. After you got the ARFF files, run the following command:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -boo -c45 ./data/train.arff ./data/test.arff
   This will run the c45 with adaboost.
4. If you want to try other options, you can run:
   $ java -jar datamining.jar -bag <train_arff_path> <test_arff_path>
   With "-bag" option it will runs the bagging procedure.

   $ java -jar datamining.jar -boo <classifier> <train_arff_path> <test_arff_path>
   With "-boo" option it will run the boosting on the base learner you input.
   Valid options for <classifier> are:
   [1] -c45    which is C4.5
   [2] -knn    which is KNN
   [3] -nb     which is Naive Bayes
   [4] -nbt    which is NBTree
