What you need before running anything:
Put the training data, testing data and checking data under 
the directory "data". For example you will need:
./data/data.csv
./data/predict.csv
./data/check.csv
And please don't delete the header file in the data folder

How to run the program in standalone mode:
(1) Build the jar:
    Cd to this directory (The folder containing this README)
    Run the following command:
    $ ant jar
(2) You may provide relative path:
    * (1)hadoop jar MapReduce_A3.jar -s -learn <train.csv>
    * (2)hadoop jar MapReduce_A3.jar -s -predict <model.m> <predict.csv>
    * (3)hadoop jar MapReduce_A3.jar -s -check <predict.csv> <check.csv> 

How to run the program in cluster mode (Buggy):
(1) Upload the MapReduce_A3.jar to your S3 bucket.
(2) In the folder that the jar resides in, create a data folder,
    and upload the header, data.csv, predict.csv, check.csv to 
    this folder.
(3) Follow the steps in this tutorial to setup the cluster:
    https://piazza.com/class/i4ppp5auv1n7k5?cid=94
    and when you come to the step you need to run the jar:
    * (1) -c -learn <train.csv> <path_to_your_s3_bucket>
          (So here train.csv is a relative path starting from your bucket)
    * (2) -c -predict <model.m> <predict.csv> <path_to_your_s3_bucket>
    * (3) -c -check <predict.csv> <check.csv> <path_to_your_s3_bucket>
    * PLASE NOTE THAT: <path_to_your_s3_bucket> must end with a "/"

Where are the generated files:
(1) learn:
    If you run in standalone mode, the generated model.m can be found in the 
    "data" directory.
(2) predict:
    If you run in standalone mode, the generated comma separated can be found 
    in "./data/predicted-dir/part-r-0000"
(3) check:
    The result will be output to the terminal and a "log" file will be 
    generated in this directory as well.
